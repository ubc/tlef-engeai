                    <p class="about-description">
                        EngE-AI is an AI-powered study assistant platform designed specifically for chemical and material engineering students at UBC. Our platform provides guided critical thinking support following Facione's model, generates context-rich real-world troubleshooting scenarios, and acts as a 24/7 virtual tutor for CHBE and MTRL engineering courses.

                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>We aim to enhance engineering education by providing students with an intelligent study companion that guides them through problem-solving rather than providing direct answers. Through the Socratic method, students develop critical thinking skills essential for engineering practice.</p>
