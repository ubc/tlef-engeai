        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This AI is designed as a study assistant to help you understand course materials. It is not a substitute for attending lectures, completing assignments, or your own critical thinking.</p>
        <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> While we strive for accuracy, the AI can make mistakes, misunderstand context, or generate incorrect information. Always verify critical information against your course materials and lectures.</p>
        <p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> You are responsible for your own work. Do not submit AI-generated responses as your own. Use this tool to learn, not to cheat.</p>
        <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> Your conversations may be reviewed for quality assurance and to improve the system. Do not share personal or sensitive information.</p>
